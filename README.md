# Project Assignment: Design and Develop Website for Robert Fox

We have been hired by Robert Fox to design and build him a personal website.

## Client Information

Robert Fox is a 30 year old New York based Freelance UI Designer and Web Developer. He has experience working with big corporations like Apple and Microsoft.

### Logo

Robert has provided us with his logo that we'll use in the design.

## Website Structure

Robert would like a 3-page website that would showcase his work,
provide information about his services and allow potential
customers to contact him. The 3 pages are:

- Home Page
- About me
- Contact

### Home Page

The home page should show a short description of who Robert is
and what he does, along with a collection of his projects and a
call-to-action to the contact page.

He would also like to see logos of companies he worked with and
maybe some testimonials.

### About me Page

The about me page should provide more information about
Robert, some pictures of him, his services and main advantages,
testimonials and a list of tools Robert uses for design and
development.

### Contact Page

The contact page is all about providing ways for clients to reach
Robert: contact form, phone number and email.

Also, Robert would like an F.A.Q. section.

## Design Guidelines

Robert wants a modern looking website that would be easy to use
by anyone. He likes to keep things clean and simple and loves
designs with lots of whitespace.

In terms of color, he really likes the color scheme of his logo so the
website should mirror that in some shape or form.

Robert also wants the site to be responsive, so we have to make sure it looks good on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
