          <h2>I'm Robert Fox.</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Henderson, Nevada almost three decades ago. From an early age I showed interest for computers
            and that grew into a passion during high school.
          </p>

          <p>
            I got into web design and development in college. Attending the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh was
            the best decision I ever made because it showed me what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
          </p>

          <p>Currently I help businesses all around the world by designing and coding websites and mobile apps.</p>

          <p>I had the pleasure of working with big companies like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, just to name a few.</p>

          <p>Right now Iâ€™m based in New York.</p>
